## **Designing**
--------------
--------------
* Keep any good sketches. They show what you have gone through when designing the fingers. It gives you/me more to talk about in the report if we need to. 

* Annotate the sketches or explain something that might be unclear. Remember that neither Martin or I are not you and might get confused. The clearer everything is the easier it is for him to give us the marks ðŸ˜‰ 

* Version your designs. It fills up our repository and makes it look professional which translates to marks.

* YOU HAVE TO USE FIGURES AND CALCULATIONS IN YOUR DESIGN. What I mean by that is you must make calculations like torque on the servos to justify the reasons for making your design a certain way and not the other. I am happy to help you with this part if you want. 

* Give reasons for doing things the way you did. We will need show reasoning behind our choices.

* Upload important/official material on GitHub. All of us might need access to the files.

* Include any figures/materials that helped you to design the fingers

## **Testing**
------------
------------
Note down the tests you have performed on the design and note down the results. It gives: 

1. me and you something to talk about in the report
2. an idea where the design needs to be improved, where its weakest points are and where its strengths are. Nothing gives more marks than shitting on your own design in the report (mentioning the designâ€™s weaknesses and how the design could be improved further).  

If you look at the overall coursework assignment you will probably find that most things here are also mentioned there. You might have some great ideas of your own on top of what Iâ€™ve written here and so donâ€™t hesitate to implement them if you think they will help.
